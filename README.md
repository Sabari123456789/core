## Introduction

Vue.js is renowned for its simplicity and adaptability. Core is built to take advantage of these features, allowing developers to create dynamic and responsive web applications with ease. This repository serves as a foundation for your projects, providing essential tools and components to accelerate your development process.

## Getting Started

To get started with Core, you need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Vue.js. If you're new to Vue.js, consider visiting the [official Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) to familiarize yourself with the framework.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Features

- **Reactive Data Binding**: Automatically update the UI when data changes.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build reusable components for better organization.
- **Single-File Components**: Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file.
- **Vue Router**: Manage navigation in your application seamlessly.
- **Vuex**: Centralize state management for large applications.

## Installation

To install Core, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sabari123456789/core.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd core
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed Core, you can start building your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

1. Create a new Vue component in the `src/components` directory:
   ```javascript
   <template>
     <div>
       <h1>Hello, Vue.js!</h1>
     </div>
   </template>

   <script>
   export default {
     name: 'HelloWorld',
   };
   </script>

   <style scoped>
   h1 {
     color: blue;
   }
   </style>
   ```

2. Import and use the component in your main application file:
   ```javascript
   import Vue from 'vue';
   import App from './App.vue';
   import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld.vue';

   Vue.component('hello-world', HelloWorld);

   new Vue({
     render: h => h(App),
   }).$mount('#app');
   ```

3. Run your application:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
